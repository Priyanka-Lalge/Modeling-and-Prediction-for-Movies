# Modeling-and-Prediction-for-Movies

This project details our analysis of the movie dataset that contains information from Rotten Tomatos and IMDB for a random sample of movies. 
The purpose of this project is to solve the below research questions.
<pre>
• Is an Oscar winning actor or actress in the cast associated with the IMDB rating of the movie?
• Is there a difference in mean audience scores between genres?
• Which variables are associated with, and hence can be used to predict, the Rating of a movie on IMDB?
